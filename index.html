<body>
Initial design.
<ul>
<li>Bars for each task extend until due date</li>
<li>Line marches along at current time</li>
<li>A notion of progress and time required can be visualized</li>
<li>Due-dates are kept as events in a special calendar</li>
<li>Extra information is stored in the notes field of that event</li>
<li>All information should be human-readable on the Google calendar interface</li>
<li>Handling oauth for the API may require storage of keys - can we do it in the browser's local store?</li>
<li>If at all possible, have no server component - do it all in the browser</ii>
<li>Eventually have a way to edit and add tasks in the UI</li>
<li>Tasks may want to have subparts or start dates</li>
<li>Order and fade away tasks with the most important at the top</li>
<li>Be responsive to screen size so I can use this on mobile and maybe even as live calendar backgrounds.</li>
<li>Aspect ratio can determine direction. On the desktop a horizontal timeline makes sense, on mobile a vertical one is more reasonable.</li>
<li>Have the option to block out calendar commitments (and maybe filter to working hours, etc.)</li>
<li>Items may have constraints on when they can be worked on (i.e. only in the lab, etc.) It would not make sense to show them when they can't be worked on.</li>
</ul>
