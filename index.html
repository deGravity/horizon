<body>
Initial design.
<ul>
<li>Bars for each task extend until due date</li>
<li>Line marches along at current time</li>
<li>A notion of progress and time required can be visualized</li>
<li>Due-dates are kept as events in a special calendar</li>
<li>Extra information is stored in the notes field of that event</li>
<li>All information should be human-readable on the Google calendar interface</li>
<li>Handling oauth for the API may require storage of keys - can we do it in the browser's local store?</li>
<li>If at all possible, have no server component - do it all in the browser</ii>
<li>Eventually have a way to edit and add tasks in the UI</li>
<li>Tasks may want to have subparts or start dates</li>
<li>Order and fade away tasks with the most important at the top</li>
</ul>
</body>
